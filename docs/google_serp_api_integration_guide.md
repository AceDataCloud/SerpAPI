# Google SERP API Integration Instructions

Google SERP (Search Engine Results Page) is the results page that users see after entering a query in the Google search engine. It displays organic search results, ads, featured snippets, knowledge graphs, as well as various content such as images and videos, aimed at providing users with the most relevant information.

This article will provide a detailed introduction to the Google SERP API, which can provide results for queries entered in the Google search engine, and the results include many types, such as featured snippets, knowledge graphs, and images.

This document will introduce the integration instructions for the Google SERP API.

## Application Process

To use the Google SERP API, you need to first apply for the corresponding service on the [Google SERP API](https://platform.acedata.cloud/documents/44c86226-8eaa-49bf-85f3-1fae8d2e23f1) page. After entering the page, click the "Acquire" button, as shown in the image:

![](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/q6ytrc.png)

If you are not logged in or registered, you will be automatically redirected to the login page inviting you to register and log in. After logging in or registering, you will be automatically returned to the current page.

During the first application, there will be a free quota provided, allowing you to use the API for free.

## Basic Usage

First, understand the basic usage method, which is to input the type of search resource and keywords to obtain search results. You only need to simply pass the `query` field and specify the corresponding model.

For example, to find information about "apple inc," we can fill in the corresponding content on the interface, as shown in the image:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/lnqiye.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

Here, we can see that we have set the Request Headers, including:

- `accept`: the format of the response result you want to receive, filled in as `application/json`, which means JSON format.
- `authorization`: the key to call the API, which can be selected directly after application.

Additionally, the Request Body is set, including:

- `type`: the type of search resource, currently supporting only six types, with the default being `search`.
- `query`: the search keyword.
- `country`: the country where the search results are located, with the default being the United States (US).
- `language`: the language of the search results, with the default being English (en).
- `range`: the time range for the search results, with the default being unlimited.
- `number`: the page size of the search results, with the default being 10.
- `page`: the page number of the search results, with the default being 1.

After selection, you can find that the corresponding code is also generated on the right side, as shown in the image:

Click the "Try" button to conduct a test, as shown in the image above, and we obtained the following results:

}
```

The return result contains multiple fields, described as follows:

- `knowledge_graph`, the knowledge graph of the search result.
- `organic`, detailed information of the search result.
- `people_also_ask`, questions related to the search keyword.
- `related_searches`, related searches for the search keyword.

It can be seen that there is an `organic` field in the returned result, which mainly contains the results of the search keyword.

In addition, if you want to generate the corresponding interface code, you can directly copy the generated code, for example, the CURL code is as follows:

```shell
curl -X POST 'https://api.acedata.cloud/serp/google' \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {token}' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "query": "apple inc"
}'
```

The Python interface code is as follows:

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.acedata.cloud/serp/google"

headers = {
    "accept": "application/json",
    "authorization": "Bearer {token}",
    "content-type": "application/json"
}

payload = {
    "query": "apple inc"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```

## Custom Search Type

If you customize the type of search resource, we can modify the parameter `type`, which includes ordinary resources `search`, image resources `images`, news resources `news`, map resources `maps`, regional resources `places`, video resources `videos`, this article will demonstrate with video resources `videos`.

Now let's demonstrate the specific operation.

First, set the `type` parameter to `videos`, and normally pass the `query` parameter, as shown in the figure:
<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/czlt12.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

The corresponding code is as follows:

```shell
curl -X POST 'https://api.acedata.cloud/serp/google' \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {token}' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "type": "videos",
  "query": "apple inc"
}'
```

You can get the following response:

```json

  "videos": [

```

The returned result has multiple fields, described as follows:

- `news`, the list of video information in the search results.

As you can see, there is a `videos` field in the returned result, which mainly contains the results of the search keywords.

## Customizing the Country of Search Resources

This interface also supports limiting the country of the search results. We can add the `country` parameter to limit the country, with the input parameter being the abbreviation of the country, such as cn (China), us (United States). This article will take China as an example, and the specific information is as follows:

## Customizing the Time Range of Search Results
This article also allows customizing the time range of search results, which includes five options: `qdr:h` (past hour), `qdr:d` (past day), `qdr:w` (past week), `qdr:m` (past month), and by default, no restrictions. We can pass the corresponding time range through `range`, for example, setting it to `qdr:d` indicates searching for results from the past day, so the input is as follows:
